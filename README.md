# ðŸ“š My Database Learning Journey

Welcome to my **database learning repository**!

This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning process, as I study **databases** â€” from SQL and NoSQL basics to advanced queries, schema design, and beyond.

## Purpose

- Serve as a **personal reference** for what I've learned
- Help **reinforce my understanding** through hands-on practice
- Share knowledge with others who may be on a similar journey
- Organize my **database projects, exercises, notes**, and **examples** in one place

## What Youâ€™ll Find

- SQL scripts for learning and practice (`.sql` files)
- Sample databases and tables
- Possibly notes and explanations of key concepts
- Real-world examples and queries
- Experiments with MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
- Mini-projects or challenges I try along the way

## Learning Focus (so far)

- SQL CRUD operations
- Table creation & schema design
- Joins and subqueries
- Data types and constraints
- Indexing and performance
- Backup and restore
- ...and more coming soon!
